General:
- Right now users need to be part of the 'root' group in order to
  properly run the program.

Datapixx:
- Not properly closing Datapixx can result in problems. After not being
  properly treated, reading a button for example would produce garbage
  results and print a 'Mismatch Address' error. This problem could only
  be fixed by resetting the Datapixx.

Siemens Sondertyp:
- It seems like the monitor requires a warm up time before it will produce
accurate results.
- We had a strange effect that cost us time where the aspect ratio of
images (their width) would change as a function of their x position on
the screen. This turned out to be a result of the modeline. The settings
from the VSG system were copied directly to the linux system, but this
turned out to be the source of the error. It seems as though the VSG must
modify these settings before passing them to the monitor, whereas the
Datapixx passes them directly to the monitor. The original settings provided
by Siemens are the correct ones.
- The luminance as a function of intensity changes with respect to the
display size of the monitor. Typical maximum values for a properly
sized screen are around 550 cdl/m2.
- The X session can be restarted by killing the X process with 'sudo
pkill X' which is useful if you started the computer when the datapixx
was off.
- There's a weird screen flicker that occurs every once in a while which
looks like a lamp being shone from the inside of the screen. This is
likely the explanation for the spikes in the measurement data.
