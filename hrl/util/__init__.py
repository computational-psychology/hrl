        When considering monitors, one may distinguish between the actual
        luminance produced by the monitor, and the scale free 'intensity'
        that the software and computer request of the monitor. In general,
        luminance is not a simple, linear function of the requested
        intensity (typically it's a so called 'gamma function') which means
        that it is not immediately clear what luminances subjects are being
        subjected to.

        The scripts provided here can be used to generate a lookup table
        (LUT) which can in turn be used in combination with the HRL
        library to linearize the relationship between intensity and
        luminance. This allows more precise control of displayed
        luminances.

        Currently implemented commands are:

            measure - Measure the relationship between intensity and luminance
                creates: 'samples.csv'
            smooth - Apply kernel smoothing to generate an approximate function
                creates: 'gamma.csv'
            linearize - Invert the function approximation to generate a final lookup table
                creates: 'lut.csv'
            plot - Generate helpful plots for the three generated csv files
            verify - Take luminance measures given a lookup table
