# Overview

The previous pages ([minimal example](../getting-started/minimal-usage-example) 
 and [deploying your code in the lab](../getting-started/deploying-in-lab))
shows you all the **core functionality of HRL**. 
Starting from there you can (if you wish) develop you own python code to create 
your stimuli, save your data, etc.

However, over the years we have developed various useful utilities
around HRL. For example, scripts to show stimuli for inspection, before 
running the experiment. Or a clean way of reading experimental designs
and record the data.

This section shows these *useful* examples, which you can take and 
adapt as needed. These are:

- [show stimuli](show-stimuli): how to show a set of stimuli for inspection, 
  before the experiment. This can be used to control for how stimuli look like, 
  its size, etc.
- [text displays](text-displays): how to show text, for example for 
   giving instructions to the participant
- [managing data](managing-data): how to set up and read experimental 
  design files, and how to save your acquired data, all in a neat format.
