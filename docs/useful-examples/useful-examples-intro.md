# Overview

The previous two sections ([minimal example](../getting-started/minimal-usage-example) 
 and [deploying your code in the lab](../getting-started/deploying-in-lab))
shows you all the **core functionality of HRL**. 
Starting from there you can (if you wish) develop you own python code to create 
your stimuli, save your data, etc.

However, over the years in our lab we have developed various useful utilities
around HRL. For example, scripts to show stimuli for inspection, before 
running the experiment. Or a specific way of reading experimental designs
and record the data.

This section shows these *useful* examples, which you can take and 
adapt as needed.
Additionally, in the next section we provide *experiment templates*
for some frequently used psychophysical experiments. 
These templates build upon the utilities presented here.
