Latest:
- Turning double buffering back on and making it an hrl option. Turning it off
didn't do what I thought it would do. I believe there are interactions with
nvidia-settings and such that causes it to behave differently machine to
machine.
- Turned off double buffering. This might theoretically be needed again by
someone doing a graphics intensive experiment, but for now it simply makes
developing an experiment more conceptually complicated.
- Now actually finalized fitting function by replacing it with a simple
smoothing procedure.
- Calibration scripts updated.
- Essentially finalized fitting function. Don't give it datasets which are too large.

0.9.5:
- I changed around the display code a bit which produced weird errors. I fixed this in
  ways I don't fully understand... I have to now flip the image before I display it. Also
  I inlined a function at its one point of use and this *fixed* a massive display problem.
  Strange, and don't forget this.
- hrl.newTexture() accepts file names and files again, so image files can be give directly
  to hrl. I still recommend given numpy arrays directly though.
- Improved the way texture -> greyscale conversion was handled.
- rmtx and dmtx are now both fields of an hrl object. dmtx you can iterate over to get the
  design lines of your design matrix, and rmtx is a dictionary, which is written to the
  result file when hrl.writeResultLine() is called.
- hrl is now an iterator and iterates over design matrix lines if that functionality is
  enabled. So now you can write for dsgn in hrl:
- Removed exit call from hrl.user
- escapeCheck renamed to checkEscape.
- Default argument names of HRL have changed.
- Moved INSTALL into a general README. README updated.
- Hid various HRL object attributes. Now listing the elements of an hrl object will only
  list the methods associated with it. HRL instances should now be a very good way of
  accessing documentation.
- HRL.tryReadLuminance has been renamed HRL.readLuminance
- Improved documentation
- HRL.buttonLoop is now called HRL.readButton. If datapixx isn't present, readButton will
  call keyboardLoop which causes the coloured buttons to be replaced by the space and
  arrow keys.
- HRL.flip now takes a clear buffer and a duration argument.
- Added 'imageToGreyArray' as a top level hrl function which using PIL can convert most
  image formats into a normalized numpy array appropriate for use with hrl.
- Fixed image drawing not coordinating with coordinate system.
- Deleted luminance scaling for now as it wasn't properly implemented.
- LUT functionality now actually works. Let's say it's in beta. And HRL
  works with it too.
- Added a circle draw function. texture.draw now takes a shape
  parameter, which defaults to 'square'·

0.9.2:
- Fixed modeline problems that were distorting our monitor images. Fixed
  little settings around the code that depended on this.
- Initial version of Look Up Table builder working. Improvements coming.
- Cleaned up some documentation as well as compilation options. One can
  now compile without datapixx. Compilation also works (better, anwyay).
- buttonLoop no longer accepts None, as that was meant to indicate wait
  forever, but never did that in the first place.
- The LUT functions can now manage (and combine) multiple data files.

0.9.1:
- Implemented controllable coordinate system.
- hrl.flip now also blanks the screen, so glClear doesn't need to be
  called by the user.

0.9:
- First version tag
